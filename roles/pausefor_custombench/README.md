pausefor_custombench
=====================

Simply does an ansible pause.

For when you have a custom benchmark or workload that is not part
of this harness, but want to use its features like system stats
collection, use pausefor_custombench as a dummy benchmark, while
concurrently running your benchmark or workload.
